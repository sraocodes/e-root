The E-root Project
E-root Project Logo

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the E-root project webpage! This project, funded by FNRS Belgium, was a pioneering endeavor in the field of plant-root-soil interactions from 2016 to 2020. Spearheaded by three distinguished experts: Sarah Gare, Mathieu Javaux, and Frederic Nguyen, the E-root project aimed to unlock the secrets of the electrical signatures of plant roots in soil.

Project Overview
The primary goal of the E-root project was to understand the complex interactions between plants and the soil they grow in. By investigating the electrical properties of plant roots in different soil environments, the project sought to advance our knowledge of plant behavior, nutrient uptake, and adaptation to changing soil conditions.

Team Members
The E-root project was led by three renowned experts in the field:

Sarah Gare
Mathieu Javaux
Frederic Nguyen
These experts provided valuable guidance and expertise throughout the project's duration.

Additionally, two dedicated Ph.D. students played a pivotal role in conducting the research and experiments:

Sathyanarayan Rao
Solomon Ehosioke
