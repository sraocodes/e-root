            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <img src="images/eroot1.png" alt="Image 1">
            <p> 
                The E-root project, funded by <a href="https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/" target="_blank">FNRS Belgium</a>, was a pioneering endeavor 
                from 2016 to 2020 in the field of plant-root-soil interactions, spearheaded 
                by three distinguished experts: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahgarre/" target="_blank">Sarah Gare</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieu-javaux-626b896/" target="_blank">Mathieu Javaux</a>, and 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric-nguyen-62974082/" target="_blank">Frederic Nguyen</a>. 
                Under their guidance, two dedicated Ph.D. students, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sathyanarayanrao1/" target="_blank">Sathyanarayan Rao</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/solomonehosioke/" target="_blank">Solomon Ehosioke</a>, embarked on an ambitious journey to unlock the secrets of the 
                electrical signatures of plant roots in soil.

            <h3>Electrical Properties of roots</h3>
            <p> 
                In simple terms, the electrical properties of roots are essential because they help us 
                understand how plants interact with the soil and how they take up water and nutrients. 
                This knowledge is crucial for sustainable agriculture and food production. Traditional 
                methods of studying soil and roots have limitations in capturing the dynamic and 
                complex patterns in the root zone. Geophysical methods, like electrical measurements, 
                offer a noninvasive way to study the root system's distribution and its impact on soil 
                conditions. These methods can help farmers improve irrigation efficiency, map soil 
                properties for precision agriculture, and study fundamental interactions between 
                plants and the environment.

            <h3>E-root Achievements</h3>
            <p> We're thrilled to share some groundbreaking achievements from the E-Root project, where 
                we've been delving deep into the fascinating world of soil-root electrical interaction. 
                Our efforts have led to some exciting milestones that promise to revolutionize our 
                understanding of plant roots and their electric signatures.</p>
            <p>The first major breakthrough came in the form of a sophisticated soil-root finite 
                element model. This powerful tool has the ability to simulate both electric and 
                water flow equations, thanks to the ingenious combination of state-of-the-art models 
                like <a href="https://sites.uclouvain.be/RSWMS/" target="_blank">R-SWMS</a>, 
                <a href="https://github.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox" target="_blank">C-Plantbox</a>,
                 <a href="http://gmsh.info" target="_blank">GMSH</a>, 
                 <a href="http://eidors3d.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">EIDORS</a>, and others. 
                 This coupled model enables us to explore the electrical signatures of various root 
                 architectures and conduct virtual geo-electric measurements. 
                 The applications of this model extend beyond merely understanding root electrical 
                 properties; it can also optimize injection schemes for geo-electric methods, such as 
                 Electrical Resistivity Tomography on cropped soils. This opens up a whole new realm 
                 of possibilities for precision agriculture and environmental monitoring. Please see
                 the publication <a href="https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2136/vzj2019.04.0037"

            <p> But that's not all: we didn't stop there! The second achievement of the E-Root project 
                involves pioneering experiments at the single root segment scale. These experiments aim 
                to quantify the induced polarization signatures of plant roots, an essential aspect of 
                developing non-invasive electrical monitoring techniques. Understanding root processes 
                like nutrient or water uptake and root growth without disturbing the natural environment 
                is crucial, and our novel experiments have paved the way for significant advancements in 
                this area.<a href="https://pureportal.ilvo.be/en/publications/spectroscopic-approach-toward-unraveling-the-electrical-signature"

            </p>
            <p> Throughout the project, our team has honed its expertise in modeling soil-root systems 
                at different scales – from individual plants to vast fields. This includes mastering 
                electric and water processes and setting up experiments to characterize plant electrical
                 properties. The knowledge gained is not only vital for the success of our project but 
                 also holds immense promise for future studies in the field of plant-root interactions.

            <h2>Sathyanarayan Rao's Thesis</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sathyanarayanrao1/" 
                target="_blank">Sathyanarayan Rao's</a>
                
                worked on an exciting Ph.D. project as part of the E-root initiative. The goal was to 
                explore how plant roots impact the electrical properties of soil. We used Electrical 
                Resistivity Tomography (ERT), a valuable tool to study soil water movement in the root 
                zone. However, traditional ERT results didn't consider the influence of roots on the 
                soil's electrical conductivity.

                In this project, We developed a special model to understand the electrical 
                processes happening in the soil-plant system when exposed to an external electric field. 
                At a microscopic level, We created a new model that considered how soil and roots' 
                polarization affected the electrical behavior. We also studied how different root 
                characteristics influenced these properties.
                
                Next, We worked on electrical models for individual root segments and 
                integrated them into complete, growing root architectures. This helped predict 
                and understand the effective electrical properties of the soil-root system. 
                To make these models more accurate, they combined them with existing root 
                growth and soil water models. This allowed us to study the relationship 
                between electrical properties and plant growth.
                
                Overall, Sathyanarayan's research contributed to a better understanding of how 
                plants and soil interact electrically, and it may lead to improved agricultural 
                monitoring practices in the future.

            <h3>The Central Objective</h3>
            <p>The central objective of this thesis was to develop a numerical model capable of capturing both direct and indirect electrical
                impacts of plant roots in geoelectric measurements, specifically electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). In this study, a
                combination of surface and depth electrodes with high spatial resolution was used to map 2-D changes of bulk soil electrical
                conductivity (EC) in an agronomic trial with different herbaceous species. The impact of root segments was incorporated in
                the forward electrical model using the finite element scheme.

            <h3>Methodology and Findings</h3>
            <p>
                The thesis successfully achieved one of the closest computer model representations of a 
                rooted soil in understanding electrical signatures of root systems in soils. The findings 
                from Sathyanarayan's thesis opened up new avenues for understanding root-soil electrical 
                interactions,demonstrating how electrical measurements could offer valuable insights into 
                root architecture and water uptake patterns. 
                This newfound knowledge has practical applications in crop phenotyping using geoelectric 
                methods such as Electrical Resistivity tomography and GPR and remote sensing,and beyond,
                where optimizing irrigation strategies, monitoring root health, and assessing 
                soil properties become more informed and effective. For further information, see our

            <h2>Solomon Ehosioke's Thesis</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/solomonehosioke/">Solomon Ehosioke's</a> Ph.D. thesis within the E-root project
                     embarks on a captivating journey into the realm of root zone investigation using 
                     low-frequency electrical techniques. Root systems play a crucial role in the growth 
                     and development of plants, and understanding their intricate processes has been a 
                     subject of unwavering curiosity for Solomon. His research delves into the electrical 
                     conduction and polarization mechanisms within the soil-root continuum, seeking to 
                     shed light on the fascinating world of roots.
                </p>

            <div class="section-content">
            <h3>Set-Up and Findings</h3>
                <p> In his thesis, Solomon rigorously evaluates various electrical methods for root 
                    investigation, providing insights into their potential and limitations. From 
                    current injection in the plant stem to multi-electrode measurements, he explores 
                    the nuances of these techniques to better understand their applicability in root 
                    zone studies. Among these methods, frequency-dependent impedance measurements 
                    stood out as a promising avenue, enabling a spectroscopic approach that captures 
                    both surface and volumetric properties.
                </p>
                <p>A key takeaway from Solomon's research is the recognition of the importance of 
                    understanding small-scale polarization and conduction mechanisms. This understanding 
                    is essential to accurately interpret electrical signatures at larger field scales. 
                    Computer models often needs validation through meticulous small-scale electrical 
                    measurements that this thesis achieved through meticulous experiments on root systems, 
                    aiming to enhance the precision and accuracy of multi-electrode tomographic techniques 
                    for root zone investigation.

                     We also found that root anatomy is a controlling factor for the electrical signature. 
                     Resistivity magnitude correlated with cell wall and void density of plant roots, 
                     while phase peak correlated with root area and were plant species dependent. For further information, check
